# Cell Controlled Robot
This is a project in which I, along with a group of friends, developped a robot with Arduino that had the following three main functionalities:

## Cellular Remote Control
The robot was capable of receiving text messages with dynamic numbers of instructions and parsing the information, which allowed it to determine which 
action to perform. The available commands could make it go forwards, backwards, pivot right, pivot left, and stop for given amounts of time.

## Line Following
The robot was also able to follow a black line on the ground using a set of three optical sensors.

## Object Avoidance
The last capability of the robot was that it could avoid object in it's path using a sonar sensor. If an object was detected, the robot would continue
to scan both the right and left directions, and determine which path was best.
